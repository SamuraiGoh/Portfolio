<h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Sam Goh and I am from Minneapolis Minnesota I moved to Oregon to go to school at the University Of Oregon in Eugene. I am currently a freshman in the school of journalism and communication. I am interested in photography and videography and take inspiration from my love of film. My favorite thing to photograph is nature and wildlife. I have spent a lot of my life outside and love hiking in national parks and nature. Another hobby of mine is cooking. I like to cook for myself and others.
    </p>
    <p>One of my favorite things to do when I am not in school is travel. My favorite way to travel is by road trip but I have flown out of the country before. I like to experience different cultures and eat a variety of foods. My family is originally from Singapore and I like to go back every now and then. I have been to parts of Europe and most of the United States. I have thought about doing a semester abroad. I hope to continue travelling the world.
